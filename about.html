        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This smart dashboard examines housing affordability in Seattle through three lenses:
          rent burden (the share of renter households spending more than 50% of income on housing),
          renter household income distribution, and the spatial coverage of
          <span class="highlight">Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA)</span> zoning policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          By mapping MHA zones alongside trend data spanning 2006–2022, the dashboard gives
          residents, advocates, and policymakers a spatial and temporal view of housing inequality
          in one of the fastest-growing cities in the U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was built for <span class="highlight">GEOG 458: Advanced Digital Geographies</span>
          at the University of Washington, Winter 2025.
        </p>

      <!-- ---- Project Goal ---- -->
      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Project Goal</h2>
        <p>
          The central question driving this project is:
          <span class="highlight">Where has Seattle implemented Mandatory Housing Affordability
          zoning, and is the citywide rent burden improving or worsening over time — and for whom?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than presenting a policy evaluation, this is an exploratory tool — designed to
          surface spatial and demographic patterns that are hard to see in tables or reports alone.
          The dashboard is intended for Seattle residents and renters, housing rights organizations,
          urban planners, community groups working on affordable housing, and researchers studying
          urban inequality.
        </p>

      <!-- ---- Broader Impacts & Limitations ---- -->
      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Broader Impacts &amp; Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          This dashboard has potential utility beyond the classroom. It could serve as a tool for
          housing rights activist groups, tenant advocacy organizations, and urban planners who need
          accessible, data-driven visualizations of spatial inequality in housing costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are aware that visualizing areas with high rent burdens could contribute to stigmatization
          or provide information useful for gentrification. To mitigate this, we focus on citywide
          trends rather than targeting specific neighborhoods, contextualize all data with explanatory
          text, and make clear that this tool is intended for advocacy and awareness — not for
          real estate investment decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key limitation of this dashboard is that our rent burden and renter income datasets are
          citywide aggregates — they do not have census tract-level geometry. As a result, the map
          displays MHA zone boundaries rather than a choropleth of burden by neighborhood. Future
          versions of this project could incorporate ACS tract-level data to enable a spatial
          overlay of burden and zoning policy.
